# About Me
The following projects are my endeavors in the data science field. I have a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and have taught high school mathematics for six years. I have been studying data analytics online and want to further apply what I have learned through these projects. 

# Visualizations
I created a dashboard of [Seoul Average Weekday Bike Ride Rentals per Hour in 2018](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jocelyn.moreno/viz/SeoulAverageWeekdayBikeRentalsperHourin2018_16916149608860/Sheet2) on Tableau. The dashboard displays this by season. 

# Stocks 2023 Project
I analyzed Investor Business Daily's 100 Best Stocks 2023 and found the top 25% of stocks that are high reward low risk. I used the closing stock of yfiance database.
